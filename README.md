# 🔐 Password Based Door Lock System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Password Based Door Lock System** using a microcontroller, keypad, LCD display, and motor. The system authenticates users through password verification and controls door access electronically.

The project eliminates traditional key-based locks and improves security using embedded authentication mechanisms.
